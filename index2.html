                    <span class="bold">(CNN) -</span> In an exclusive interview with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/sport/">CNN Sport</a>, 
                    Chelsea striker <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/08/football/romelu-lukaku-racism-euro-2020-cmd-spt-intl/index.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> has urged the CEOs of social media 
                    companies to sit down with leading Premier League stars to try and put an end to the abuse that footballers receive online.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have implemented several new measures in recent months, 
                    such as being able to limit who can respond to posts, but star players in both the men's and women's 
                    game still regularly find themselves subjected to racist, sexist and homophobic abuse, as well as death threats.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    This issue is personal for Lukaku, who has been 
                    <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/02/football/romelu-lukaku-cagliari-inter-milan-serie-a-racism-spt-intl/index.html">targeted by racist fans in the past</a>, 
                    and the Belgian international explains why he wants to be more directly involved.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    "I have to fight," he told CNN's <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/profiles/amanda-davies">Amanda Davies</a>. "Because I'm not fighting only for myself. I'm fighting for my son, 
                    for my future kids, for my brother, for all of the other players and their kids, you know, for everybody."
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Lukaku believes it's now time for all parties -- footballers, social media companies and governing bodies -- 
                    to come together and take on the responsibility of ending the abuse.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    "The captains of every team, and four or five players, like the big personalities of every team, 
                    should have a meeting with the CEOs of Instagram and governments and the FA and the PFA, 
                    and we should just sit around the table and have a big meeting about it," Lukaku says.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    "How we can attack it straight away, not only from the men's game, but also from the women's game.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    "I think just all of us together and just have a big meeting and have a conference and just talk 
                    about stuff that needs to be addressed to protect the players, but also to protect fans and younger 
                    players that want to become professional footballers."

                <h2>
                    'Football is joy'
                </h2>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Lukaku was speaking to CNN Sport around the launch of Chelsea's 'No To Hate' photography competition, 
                    which is encouraging fans of the club around the world to send in their photos that show the diversity 
                    within the Chelsea community and how football can be a unifying factor against hatred and discrimination in any form.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    The 'No To Hate' campaign was originally launched back in March by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich following the 
                    "disgusting and unacceptable racist abuse" Chelsea defender Reece James received in January.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Lukaku has often received racist abuse on the pitch throughout his career, notably during his time with Inter Milan in Italy, 
                    and recently told CNN that he believes racism in football is at an "all-time high."
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    However, he says the constant fight against racism is not one he will ever grow weary of.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    "At the end of the day, football should be an enjoyable game," he said. "You cannot kill 
                    the game by discrimination. That should never happen.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    "Football is joy, it's happiness and it shouldn't be a place where you feel unsafe because of the opinion from some uneducated people."
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    A spokesperson for the Football Association (FA) told CNN that it has contacted Chelsea directly to arrange a discussion with Lukaku. 
                    "We always welcome conversations on this important subject with players and others across the game," the spokesperson said.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Similarly, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) has reached out to Lukaku through Chelsea captain CÃ©sar Azpilicueta to try 
                    and organize a meeting and find out how they can better work together.
